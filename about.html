							<h2>About</h2>
			<h3>Eddie Croft Offers An Intangible Service to San Mateo</h3>
			<h4>History as a San Mateo Champion</h4>
			<p>
			Eddie Croft has uniquely contributed to San Mateo’s history. He is the first resident of San Mateo to win a State kickboxing championship and three San Francisco Golden Gloves championships. Upon turning to the world of professional boxing, he made a rapid ascent in the world rankings and captured the World Boxing Council’s Continental America’s Super-Bantamweight Title. He then contended for the World Championships against recent boxing legends, Tom “Boom Boom” Johnson, Erik “El Terrible” Morales, and Marco Antonio-Barrera. Even after a brief three year retirement, Croft returned to the ring to capture the International Sport Karate Association Featherweight U.S. Kickboxing Championship.
			His professional career was cut short by an eye injury, which he suffered during the training camp for his first chance at a World Championship. He sustained nerve damage to his left eye, effectively turning him into a one-eyed boxer, which severely affected his depth-perception. His valiant efforts in the challenges for World Titles did not go unnoticed by the boxing community, and he was held in even higher regard upon learning of the eye injury.
			</p>
			<h4>Qualifications as a Trainer</h4>
			<p>
			Despite his individual success as a fierce competitor, Croft’s proudest achievements come as a trainer and teacher. He trained a professional World Kickboxing Champion, five San Francisco Golden Glove Champions, and many others in various disciplines of combat sports. Due to the wealth and variety of his knowledge, he has set a new goal: to become the first, and possibly the only person to train a boxing, kickboxing and mixed-martial arts champion.
			Eddie is certified by USA Boxing as a Level II coach and licensed by the California State Athletic Commission both a coach and a manager.
			Additionally, Eddie Croft has taught multiple self-defense workshops.
			</p>
			<h4>Martial Arts Background</h4>
			<p>	
			Eddie received his black belt in Tae Kwon Do at eleven years old and is now a third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.
			He was also a part-owner of Golden State Tae Kwon Do and Undisputed Boxing Gym.
